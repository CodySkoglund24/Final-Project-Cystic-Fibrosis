        <h1>What is Cystic Fibrosis</h1>
            <p class="info">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder that causes severe 
                damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, 
                sweat and digestive juices.  <br>
                I am using this website to spread awareness and see if people are willing
            to do a little research on this disease or possibly even donate to the cause</p>

            <br>
            <h2>How can CF affect your life?</h2>

            <p>Over time, the ongoing obstruction of air passages and buildup of mucus can lead to recurrent infections, irreversible lung damage, and other serious 
                complications such as malnutrition, diabetes, and more. <br> 
                As a progressive disease, cystic fibrosis needs to be treated early to preserve lung function and reduce the inflammatory burden on the body.</p>
