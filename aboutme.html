        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Cody Skoglund and like I had mentioned before I have Cystic Fibrosis.
            Never in my life have I let this disease run my life. For the most part I have 
            lived a normal life. I have a girlfriend, I have a really nice, job and I have 
            some amazing friends who have stuck by my side since day 1. I am a huge fan of sports
            and love watching them in person. I would like to think I am funny and hard working
            no matter what my family says. I live with my mom, dad, and brother and they are my biggest supporters
            and they are the reason that I am writing this right now
